# ofxRapidLib
ofxRapidLib is an [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) wrapper for the RapidLib library. RapidLib is a lightweight, interactive machine learning library intended to be used in interactive music and visual projects. It was directly inspired by Rebecca Fiebrink's [Wekinator](http://www.wekinator.org/), and was written in collaboration with her at Goldsmiths, University of London, as part of the [RAPID-MIX](http://rapidmix.goldsmithsdigital.com/) project.

RapidLib is an open source, cross-platform project and is avaiable under a BSD license.
